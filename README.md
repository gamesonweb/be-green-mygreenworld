# MyGreenWorld

Welcome to MyGreenWorld, an exciting web game created for this year's CGI Games On Web contest with the theme "Be Green". In this game, you will have the opportunity to generate money in a city while respecting the ecological impact. MyGreenWorld combines the mechanics of a clicker game such as "Cookie Clicker" with the management challenges of a city such as "SimCity".

## Description
Your main objective is to generate as much money as possible by simply using your mouse. However, there is a big difference compared to other clicker games: here, you will also have to take into account the ecological impact of your actions. You will have to find the right balance between generating income and respecting the environment to create a prosperous and sustainable city.

## How to play?
1. Go to the [MyGreenWorld](https://mygreenworld.netlify.app/) link in your browser to launch the game.
2. Click on the tree displayed on the screen to generate virtual money.
3. Use the money you have generated to purchase various upgrades and additions to your city. You can access the store in the menu on the right side of the window.
4. In the store you will find various upgrade options for your city, such as houses, shops and improvements. Each improvement has a cost and an associated environmental impact.
5. Be sure to carefully monitor the overall environmental impact of your city. If you exceed certain environmental impact thresholds, negative consequences may occur.
6. Keep clicking to generate money and improve your city to maximize your revenue while minimizing your environmental impact.

## Story
You have just been called by a deity for an experience to which many other players have been invited. The goal of this deity is to find a successor who will be able to manage a world while being as environmentally friendly as possible. To show your skills, it gives you the opportunity to access a virtual city. You can develop it by generating money by clicking on the tree of life in the center of it, but beware the less ecological your city is and the less prosperous it will be. Make the right choices!
